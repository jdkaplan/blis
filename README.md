# Blis

A hobby programming language for learning interpreter implementation techniques

This project is "overengineering for fun". I hope to implement more features
and useful programming tools as a way to learn how they work.

## Examples

I'll write a real-ish program in Blis eventually. But for now, I have my
[test_programs](test_programs).

## About the name

I've implemented some silly languages for [Quirky Languages Done Quick], and I
wanted to have a long-term project that's the "opposite", in a way. Switching
each word out gives me "Boring Language Iterated Slowly".

And then, since I don't want it to yell at me in all caps, I spell it as "Blis".
